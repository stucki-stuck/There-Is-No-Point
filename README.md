# There-Is-No-Point

This project has no point. Literally.

It’s a personal portfolio that showcases my skills as a DevOps engineer, built around
experimentation, automation, and continuous learning.

I’ve been working as a DevOps engineer for 5 years, and I felt it was time to take stock of what
I’ve learned. This project gives me a space to practice, explore, and experiment with DevOps
patterns and tools.

The initial goal is to deploy a Kubernetes cluster running a set of microservices. I’m not aiming to
build a specific software application, but rather to set up an infrastructure composed of
interconnected open-source services.

The platform should be bootstrappable locally, using [k3d](https://k3d.io/stable/) to spin up a
lightweight Kubernetes cluster.

## 🧰 Technologies Used
